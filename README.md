A full report of the research process and rationale, as well as how data was collected and processed, is available by request.

If you are running this in an IDE like VSCode to run a live server, please ensure that the folder of the README
message is the project directory. 

May not run if you try to run index.html directly in a web browser. From my experience VSCode's "Open with Live Server" always works.

This project was developed for a university coursework but uses and processes real-world data from the London Data Store.
